                 <h2>Games That Help Me Get Through The Pandemic</h2>
                 <img src="game.jpeg" alt="game" height="200">
                 <p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been a significant effect on peoples’ mental health.
                     The main reason for this is the increased levels of stress and anxiety that people are experiencing.
                     This is due to the uncertain nature of the situation, as well as the fear of contracting the virus.
                     Animal Crossing: This game is all about building my own little world and taking care of it. It’s a relaxing and fun game that can help take my mind off of the stress of the outside world. In addition, the social interaction in this game can be really beneficial. 
                    I got to create my houses. I was also able to celebrate Christmas and New Years’ eve with my online friends.</p>

                    <img src="bad.png" alt="badnews" height="200">
                    <p>It has become a part of my daily routine. I turn on my little Bluetooth speaker and listen to one of the major news channels while I tidy the kitchen after dinner. As I scrub a grease-covered pan, something along the lines of "another mass shooting" plays over the speaker. Or something about how there have been more lives lost to some natural disaster somewhere. 
                       Or whatever else - there doesn't seem to be a shortage of bad news lately.</p>

                    <h2>Electric Vehicles Are The Future.</h2>
                    <img src="ev.jpeg" alt="electric vechiles" height="200">
                    <p>The shift to electrified mobility started nearly two decades ago with the arrival of the first hybrid vehicles. Although most car buyers were not initially comfortable with the idea of a gas-electric powertrain, hybrids continued to gain popularity. Eventually, they served as a bridge to more sophisticated and sustainable offerings, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) 
                        and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), with ranges currently surpassing 300 miles on a single charge.</p>
